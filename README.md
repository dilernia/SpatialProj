# Spatial Analysis of Minneapolis Crime Data
Implemented a spatio-temporal model in R to analyze reported crime rates in Minneapolis neighborhoods using weather data, population sizes, and other various sources. A slide presentation summarizing results is available [here](https://github.com/dilernia/SpatialProj/blob/master/Spatial_Proj_Pres.pdf).
